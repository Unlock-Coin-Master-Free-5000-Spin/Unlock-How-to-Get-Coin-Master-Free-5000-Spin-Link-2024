The ultimate goal is to build your village and progress through different stages by upgrading buildings, collecting cards, and completing sets.

One of the most important resources in the game is spins, which allow you to spin the slot machine and earn coins and other rewards. The more spins you have, the more opportunities you have to earn coins, attack, or raid and progress faster.
